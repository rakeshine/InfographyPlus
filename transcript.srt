1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
in a world driven by power, profit and propaganda.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
There are very few relationships that survive the test of time, war and politics.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
But one such bond stands tall, unshaken, unbent.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The bond between India and Russia.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Not based on deals, not based on pressure,

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
but built on trust, respect and a brotherhood that bled together and stood together.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The year was 1947.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Even before the tricolor flew high above free India,

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
in April the Soviet Union opened its embassy in New Delhi.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Not to dominate, not to dictate,

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
but to say in quiet but powerful brotherhood tone,

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
we are with you.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Fast forward to 1971, India stood at the brink of war,

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
a humanitarian crisis, millions of refugees fleeing East Pakistan.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And the world?

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It watched and stayed silent.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The US, under Nixon, sent its 7th fleet to the Bay of Bengal,

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
not to help but to threaten.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The UK criticised us.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The UN, manipulated by the West, tried to condemn us.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
But in those darkest hours, one nation stood up.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Russia.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The Soviet Union vetoed not once, not twice,

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
but three times to block anti-India resolutions.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And it didn't stop there.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
In 1971, it signed the Treaty of Peace and Friendship,

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
shielding India from a two-front threat, China and Pakistan.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
That was not just diplomacy, that was blood-deep loyalty.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
While the West debated, delayed and dictated, Russia acted.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Sukhoi jets secure our skies, T-90 tanks defend our borders,

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
INS Vikramaditya rules this sea,

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
and Brahmo's a thunderbolt of Indo-Russian brilliance flies with pride.

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Not bought, not borrowed, built together.

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
While the West offers deals with strings attached,

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Russia gives with one message, we trust you.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Ask yourself, why does Russia never panic when India builds ties with the United States?

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Why does it not issue threats, write reports or run headlines?

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Because Russia respects sovereignty.

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The West, it fears it.

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The US says, don't buy oil from Russia.

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Don't deploy S-400s, pick a side.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
But Russia says, walk your path, we'll walk beside you.

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The West demands alignment.

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Russia offers partnership.

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
When India stays neutral in Ukraine, the West frowns.

46
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
But Russia understands.

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Because real friends don't need validation.

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
They understand the silence between the words.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The same Europe that buys gas from Russia tells India to stop buying discounted oil.

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
The same America that trades billions with China advises India to decouple.

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,000
The same West that invaded Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya now lectures India on morality.

52
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
This is not leadership, this is hypocrisy in a suit.

53
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And we, a civilization older than their empires, will not be lectured.

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Russia supports India's permanent seat in the UN Security Council.

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
The West, they speak nice words.

56
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
But behind closed doors, they block it.

57
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
On Kashmir, Russia has always respected bilateral dialogue.

58
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The West, they try to internationalize it.

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Funded NGOs to stir unrest.

60
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Raised concerns every time India took a stand.

61
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Russia offers support.

62
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The West offers supervision.

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
India doesn't need a babysitter.

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It needs an equal.

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
While the West built walls, Russia opened doors.

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Thousands of Indian students study in Russian universities.

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Russian hearts beat with Bollywood and Bharat.

68
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Russian streets celebrate Yoga Day.

69
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
In Russia, India is not just a nation, it's family.

70
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Because this is not a policy, it is personal.

71
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Our memory runs deep.

72
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
We remember 1971.

73
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
We remember every veto, every weapon, every silent stand.

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Russia didn't just help India.

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Russia believed in India.

76
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
To the world, this may look like strategy.

77
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
But for us, it's brotherhood.

78
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Let the world take note.

79
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
India will trade with America.

80
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
India will partner with Europe.

81
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
But India will never forget those who stood by us when we stood alone.

82
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Not every friendship is a transaction.

83
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Some are written in the pages of history.

84
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And some are written in blood, trust and brotherhood.

85
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
India and Russia stand together.

86
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Not because we must, but because we always have.

87
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
This is not strategy.

88
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
This is a bond the West will never understand.
